For me, the challenge isn’t having ideas—it’s getting them out in a way that makes sense. AI isn’t replacing my voice—it’s helping me hear it more clearly.\n\n### Using AI as an assistant removes the possibility of judgment. It reduces the stigma.\n\nFor disabled people—especially those of us who struggle with cognitive load, executive function, or brain \nfog, writing isn’t just about putting words on a page. It’s about overcoming invisible barriers that others might not see. I live with autoimmune conditions and ADHD, both of which can make it difficult to translate thoughts into words, especially when fatigue or brain fog sets in. When those barriers make it difficult to organize thoughts or express ideas, it’s easy to feel self-conscious. The fear of sounding unclear, scattered, or “not smart enough” can be paralyzing, and that fear often leads to silence.\n\n### The Intersection of AI and Accessibility\n\nAI is unlike any accessibility tool we’ve had before. It’s not just about communication—it’s about helping people find their voice. Without AI, I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Maybe I wouldn’t be writing it ever. I don’t know. What I do know is that I’m thankful for this tool, because it’s allowing me to express thoughts that would otherwise stay locked inside my head.\n\nThat’s what accessibility really is. Not just making things possible, but making them reachable. AI doesn’t just help me put words on a page, it helps me claim my space in the conversation.\n\n### How AI Helps Bridge the Gap Between Thoughts and Words\n\nWhen I sit down to write, the ideas are there. I can see them, feel them, understand them. But sometimes, getting them into a structured form feels like trying to herd soot sprites from My Neighbor Totoro, the moment I reach for them, they scatter. The connections exist, but articulating them in a way that makes sense to someone else? That’s where the struggle begins.\n\nI used to be able to write without help. The words came more easily, and I didn’t need a tool to bridge the gap between my thoughts and the page. That’s changed, and I only partially understand why. But what I do know is that AI is giving me a way forward—and for that, I’m grateful.\n\nThis is where AI becomes more than just a tool—it becomes a collaborator. I have a project called “Communication Help” for moments when all I can do is brain-dump an idea without worrying about structure. I throw my raw, unfiltered thoughts into AI, and it helps me shape them into something coherent. Sometimes, I need help organizing my thoughts, so I’ll feed in a tangled mess of concepts and let AI suggest a structure. Other times, I’ll have a sentence that doesn’t quite feel right, and AI can refine it without stripping away my voice. And on the hardest days—when brain fog makes words dart around like mischievous little sprites—AI helps me get unstuck by giving me something to react to, nudging my thoughts back into motion.\n\nThe difference between using AI and asking a person for help is simple: there’s no pressure. AI doesn’t need me to explain why I’m struggling. It doesn’t get impatient. It doesn’t expect me to have things figured out before I start. It just meets me where I am, making the process of writing feel less like a battle and more like a conversation.\n\n### AI as an Accessibility Tool, Not a Replacement\n\nIn fact, this very article is an example of what I mean. As I write, I’m not just feeding AI a command and passively accepting what it gives me. I’m engaging with it, refining my thoughts, bouncing ideas back and forth. It’s a conversation—one that helps me capture the thoughts that might otherwise slip away. AI isn’t replacing my voice; it’s helping me hear it more clearly.\n\nBut this level of support doesn’t happen instantly. AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a tool that learns. It doesn’t just follow commands; it adapts to how I think, how I write, and how I refine my ideas. The more I use it, the better it understands what kind of help I actually need. No other tool has ever worked with me like this—meeting me where I am and shaping itself to fit me. It’s not perfect, and sometimes it still gives me something that doesn’t fit. But that’s part of the process. Just like any good accessibility tool, it works with me, not just for me.\n\nThis is why AI shouldn’t be dismissed as just a convenience or a shortcut. For many of us, it’s an accessibility tool—one that removes barriers, reduces stigma, and creates new ways for disabled people to express themselves. Writing is just one example, but the implications stretch far beyond that. AI has the potential to bridge gaps in communication, cognitive processing, and executive function in ways we’re only beginning to understand.\n\nBut for AI to truly be an accessibility win, it has to be built with disabled people in mind—not as an afterthought, but as part of its foundation. Because at its best, AI isn’t about doing the work for us. It’s about giving us the tools to do it ourselves.","src/data/blog/ai-as-an-accommodation.md",[31],"../../assets/images/ai-inspo.png","d86459f02a104ed8",{"html":34,"metadata":35},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;../../assets/images/ai-inspo.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;A warm and inviting scene of a person using AI-powered tools.

Instead, what unfolded was a thoughtful conversation that gently unpacked a much deeper tension in AI design. It almost felt like Claude led the discussion, asking the right questions back, steering us into nuance.\n\nThe very things that make Claude feel human can make it hard to use.\n\n## The Design Tradeoff\n\nClaude has strict usage limits that vary based on conversation complexity:\n\n- Standard conversations: roughly 45 messages every 5 hours (Anthropic Help Center, n.d.)\n- With large files or complex threads: as few as 15 messages \n- Once you hit the limit, you're forced to start a new thread\n\nThis creates a fundamental accessibility barrier: forced context switching. If you don't experience ADHD, that might sound small. But for me — and many others — it's not.\n\nSwitching threads mid-thought is like having your train of thought derailed by a brick wall. It takes real effort to re-orient, reload the context, and try to continue where I left off. When I'm finally in flow on a complex problem, getting kicked out means starting over — not just technically, but cognitively.\n\n## The Accessibility Paradox\n\nClaude's design is built around high-EQ interaction:\n\n- Trained using Constitutional AI to prioritize helpfulness, empathy, and alignment (Anthropic, 2023)\n- Designed to maintain conversational continuity and emotional intelligence \n- Built to feel more like collaborating with a thoughtful colleague than querying a database\n\nBut these strengths demand more computational resources per interaction, which drives the strict usage limits.\n\nSo we land in a paradox: Claude is designed to be more accessible through conversation quality, but its limits create less accessibility for sustained usage.\n\nThis isn't bad intentions — it's a classic design conflict. The feature that's supposed to help me also makes it unusable for the way I work.\n\n## My Hybrid Solution\n\nLike many users, I've built a workaround:\n\n- ChatGPT for ongoing workflows that require continuous thought \n- Claude when I want a second opinion, emotional nuance, or just to feel heard\n\nThis isn't ideal, but it's realistic. No tool is perfect. Each serves a role.\n\nStill, the experience has stuck with me. It's a reminder that accessibility isn't just about what a tool can do — it's also about what it lets you keep doing. Continuity, for some of us, is everything.\n\n## Beyond the Individual Workaround\n\nThe deeper issue isn't just personal frustration. When forced context switching disrupts sustained work, insights get lost. Complex problems that require iterative thinking get abandoned. The very users who might benefit most from AI collaboration — those who think differently — get systematically excluded from longer-form engagement.\n\nThis matters beyond individual productivity. If AI tools are going to be genuinely collaborative, they need to accommodate different cognitive patterns, not just different conversation styles.\n\n## Final Thought\n\nWe talk a lot about AI alignment and safety. But we need to talk more about usability — especially for people whose cognitive patterns don't fit the norm. Accessibility isn't always about screen readers or alt text. Sometimes, it's about not being kicked out of the room just when your brain finally clicks into gear.\n\nThat's not a bug. It's a design gap. And it's fixable — through tiered usage models, better session persistence, or simply acknowledging that some users need sustained access to think effectively.\n\nThe question is whether we choose to see it.\n\nReferences\nAnthropic.
