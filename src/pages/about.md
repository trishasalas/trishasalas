I build things—tools, bridges between teams, solutions to problems that don't fit neatly into existing categories. My background spans WordPress core contributions, custom web development, and over a decade in accessibility consulting. I've learned that the best solutions come from understanding the history of a problem, seeing the unique angles others might miss, and creating alternative paths forward when the obvious ones don't work.

I'm a developer at heart. I solve hard problems, refactor messy systems, and architect solutions that work across different environments. I care about clean code, maintainable architecture, and solutions that actually reduce friction for the people using them. My CliftonStrengths—Context, Developer, Individualization, Intellection, Strategic—basically mean I'm the person who asks "but why does it work that way?" and then builds something better.

I knit, keep too many plants alive, and genuinely enjoy the kind of collaborative problem-solving where people push back on my ideas and make them stronger.
